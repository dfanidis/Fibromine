</h2>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Fibromine is a Shiny-based web server that aims to accelerate IPF research by providing functionalities for three point-of-view integration and exploration of numerous IPF and IPF-related transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. In addition, Fibromine includes a custom datasets benchmarking strategy in an attempt to reveal otherwise "invisible" datasets characteristics.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	All Fibromine functionalities are highly user-tunable and results, as well as Fibromine included data, can be easily downloaded.

	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<strong>Dataset explorer</strong> facilitates transcriptomic and proteomic datasets review and integration. Consensus differentially expressed genes and proteins can be fetched along with exploratory heatmaps and volcano plots for the transcriptomic datasets. 
	</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<strong>Gene explorer</strong> enables the interrogation of gene expression patterns for either single or multiple genes at the same time. Apart from basic gene annotation, further data regarding respective gene ontology, RefSeq sequences and miRNA-mRNA interactions are provided.
	</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<strong>Protein explorer's</strong> main functionality is to plot condition-specific protein-protein interaction networks revolving around the protein queried. In addition, protein differential expression pattern is fetched from Fibromine included proteomic datasets.
	</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<strong>Datasets benchmarking</strong> tab displays the results of the deployed custom strategy for Fibromine datasets benchmarking.
	</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<strong>Download data</strong> tab enables on-click download of normalized transcriptomics data and differential expression analysis results for proteomics datasets.
