	Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is a progressive pulmonary disease of unknown etiology characterized, among others, by extensive lung scarring and fibrosis. It manifests mainly into older adults, half of which usually decease due to respiratory failure 3-5 years post diagnosis.

	Despite many years of relentless attempts, the scientific community has not yet found a cure for IPF. Currently, the discovery and approval of two new anti-fibrotic treatments, nintedanib and pirfenidone, was able to delay disease progression, but not to increase overall survival, while several side effects have also been reported.

	Quickly after their first introduction to the everyday laboratory practice, omics technologies have greatly boosted biomedical research leading to several major discoveries and the inevitable accumulation of a great number of datasets. Due to the heterogeneity of the latter, their scattering across the web and the different approaches used for their analysis, a fruitful meta-analysis is a time-consuming and laborious process even for those possessing the required computational skills. Consequently, centralized repositories/web servers dedicated to the carefull collection, selection and communication are urgently needed.
